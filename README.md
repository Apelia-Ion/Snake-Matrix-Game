This is an Arduino Snake game, implemented on an 8x8 LED matrix for the mid-term project for the Introduction to Robotics class.

<summary>Backstory</summary>
<br>
The Snake game has a long and storied history, with roots dating back to the 1970s. The original Snake game was developed by Nokia for their early mobile phones, and it quickly became a worldwide phenomenon.
Although it would seem to be a boring, simple game, The Snake game holds its charm well and is still very entertaining to play. 
I chose to implement this classic game because I knew it won't fail to bring joy to the players.
